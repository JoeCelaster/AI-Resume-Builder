# AI-Resume-Builder
**Project Title: Smart Resume**

**1. Project Scope:**

Our team has decided to build a Resume Builder App — a web application that helps users easily create a professional-looking resume by entering their personal, academic, and professional details. Users will see a live preview of their resume as they fill the form and can download it as a PDF once it’s complete.

We’re focusing on:

- Building clean input forms for resume data

- Designing a responsive and printable resume preview

- Integrating a PDF export feature

- Keeping the UI minimal, easy to navigate, and professional-looking

- We may add user login and saved resumes if we finish the MVP early.

**2. Milestones & Timeline**

Timeline	Milestone:-

- Day 1 (Kickoff):	Finalized project idea, assigned team roles, planned UI layout

- Day 2:	Set up project structure, started building form sections (Personal Info, Education)

- Day 3:	Completed form inputs, connected data to preview component

- Day 4:	Styled the resume preview and added formatting

- Day 5:	Integrated PDF export feature (html2pdf.js) and tested download

- Day 6:	Bug fixes, cross-browser testing, UI improvements

- Day 7 (Final Day):	Final polish, prepare for deployment (Vercel), and internal team review

**3. Team Roles & Responsibilities**

We divided our work based on everyone’s strengths and interests:

Frontend Developer(Harshita)

handling the form creation in React, managing states for each input, and working on responsive design and layout.

Backend developer(Joe Celestar)

Focuses on backend (Node.js + Express). They’ll handle optional features like saving resume data and user auth if we have time.

integration and deployment (me- Amulya B)

Will be working on the resume preview component and integrating the PDF download/export functionality.

We also plan to collaborate closely during integration, and we’ve agreed to review each other's code through pull requests on GitHub.

**4. Anticipated Challenges & Strategies:**

Managing dynamic fields (like multiple experiences):	Use React state arrays and modular form components

Rendering a consistent PDF layout:	Stick to simple layout structure and test print previews early

Keeping the scope manageable:	Focus only on the MVP first, with optional features clearly marked

UI/UX consistency across devices:	Use Tailwind for responsive design and test on different screen sizes

Time management across tasks:	Daily check-ins, use a shared task board (Trello/GitHub Projects), and keep buffer time for testing/debugging

**5. Sprint Goal**

Our goal for this sprint is to deliver a fully functional Resume Builder App where users can fill in their details, see a live preview of the resume, and download it as a PDF. We aim for clean UI, smooth UX, and bug-free functionality. Optional features like login and resume history are planned only if time permits after the MVP is complete.
